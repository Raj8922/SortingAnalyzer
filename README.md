# SortingAnalyzer
This project is a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built with Tkinter and Matplotlib in Python. It allows users to compare the performance of various sorting algorithms visually and analytically. The program generates random numbers, sorts them using different sorting algorithms, and provides time complexity and space complexity comparisons. Additionally, the sorted and unsorted numbers are saved to text files, and a graph displaying sorting times and space complexities is generated.

Features:
Sorting Algorithms Included:

Selection Sort

Quick Sort

Merge Sort

Heap Sort

Bubble Sort

Insertion Sort

Counting Sort

Real-Time Algorithm Performance Metrics:

Time Taken (in seconds)

Space Complexity (numerical scale)

Graphical Output:

Time Complexity comparison graph

Space Complexity comparison graph

File Output:

Save unsorted numbers to a file

Save sorted numbers to a file

Interactive GUI using Tkinter for easy interaction with the program.

Requirements:
Python 3.x

tkinter

matplotlib

ttkbootstrap

How to Use:
Generate Random Numbers: Input the number of elements and the minimum and maximum values for the random number array.

Sort and Compare: Click on the "Generate and Sort" button to start sorting the numbers using different algorithms.

View Results: The sorting algorithms' performance will be displayed in a table showing the time taken and space complexity.

Graphs: You can generate graphs comparing the time and space complexity of each sorting algorithm.

View Files: View the unsorted and sorted numbers in a text file by clicking on the appropriate button.
